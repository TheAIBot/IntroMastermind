Code = array(1,4); #random numbers from 1-8

Response = empty array(1,4); # 0 (Not right),1 (Color right), or 2 (Color and position right).


S = matrix with all possible states;

Guess = random guess;
Response = get response;

State = guess and response

frontier = frontier created;
expended set = expended set created;

while Guess =! Code
{
    if frontier is empty
        return failure

    choose node n from frontier
    add n to expanded nodes

    if n is a goal state
        return solution


    for each child m of n
        if m =! frontier and if m =! expanded noeds
            add child m to frontier
}

you win
